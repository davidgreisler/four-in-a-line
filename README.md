Four in a line
============
Four in a line is a two-player game in which two players first select a color and then take turns dropping a token
of their color from the top into a grid. The token falls straight down, occupying the
lowest free cell in the grid. The first player who has four tokens in a row, either
horizontally/vertically or diagonally, wins the game.

It is possible to play the game with two human players, either locally or over the network, or with
one human player playing against a computer player. When playing over the network, the players can
communicate using an in-game chat. The number of won/lost/drawn games of each player are stored in
a highscore list.

The program was created within the scope of an assignment for the course Multimedia: Entwicklung Multimedialer Systeme.
